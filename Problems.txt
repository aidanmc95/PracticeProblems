1) Collapse a binary tree into a doubly linked list with the root of the tree in the middle and the head of the linked list as the left most element in the left subtree.

2) Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operator.

3) Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

4) Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
