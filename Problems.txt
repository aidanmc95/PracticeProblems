1) Collapse a binary tree into a doubly linked list with the root of the tree in the middle and the head of the linked list as the left most element in the left subtree.

2) Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operator.

3) Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

4) Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

5) There is a one-dimensional garden on the x-axis. The garden starts at the point 0 and ends at the point n. (i.e The length of the garden is n).

There are n + 1 taps located at points [0, 1, ..., n] in the garden.

Given an integer n and an integer array ranges of length n + 1 where ranges[i] (0-indexed) means the i-th tap can water the area [i - ranges[i], i + ranges[i]] if it was open.

Return the minimum number of taps that should be open to water the whole garden, If the garden cannot be watered return -1.

6) Given a string s, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. You must make sure your result is the smallest in lexicographical order among all possible results.

7) There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?
