1) Collapse a binary tree into a doubly linked list with the root of the tree in the middle and the head of the linked list as the left most element in the left subtree.

2) Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operator.
   - 2 / 2 = 1, 2 / 3 = 0
   - 4 / 1 = 4 20 / 5 = 4
   - subtract full amout of divisor till and count unber of times that you can
